### Designed with a 'Mobile First' responsive design.


## Wireframe
I created the Desktop, Tablet and Mobile wireframe of the Home Page in greyscale so I could see the hierarchy of the elements on the page. 

Created using Figma.

### Simplicity

- footer same feel placeing at the bottom of the page.
- icons match both from Google and Boxicons.  
- fonts match header fonts and content (paragraph) fonts.

## Testing
### Validator Testing
- HTML
<https://validator.w3.org/>

- CSS
<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>

### Manual Testing
- How I went about it.
I checked each link went to the desired page and that all < a > tags opened in a new tab.
Checked the videos and their refresh times.

The web browsers I used in manual testing are Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

DOM X-Ray

I used this Chrome extension to check the flow of white space and that the items were centred.

#### Responsive Testing
I used Chrome and Firefox "developer tools, device toggle" to check the responsiveness for each device. From iPhone, roughly 320px, to laptop 1920px, and to the desktop at 2560px (QHD).

I also used "developer tools" to check the margin and padding on each element to check the style didn't break, especially on smaller devices usually caused by margin or overflow fixed widths to elements on the page.



## Deployment
Deployed using GitHub Pages. <https://github.com/dmcginley/project1_yoga_site/settings/pages>

Once uploaded I checked everything was working ok.
