## Testing
### Validator Testing

### Manual Testing
- How I went about it.
I checked each link went to the desired page and that all < a > tags opened in a new tab.

#### Responsive Testing
I used Chrome and Firefox "developer tools, device toggle" to check the responsiveness for each device. From iPhone, roughly 320px, to laptop 1920px, and to the desktop at 2560px (QHD).

I also used "developer tools" to check the margin and padding on each element to check the style didn't break, especially on smaller devices usually caused by margin or overflow fixed widths to elements on the page.
